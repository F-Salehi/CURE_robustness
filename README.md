# CURE for adversarial vulnerability
CURE is a deep network training algorithm via a curvature regularizer. Networks trained using CURE can achieve significant adversarial robustness.

### Dependencies
---
The code is compatible with python3.7. To install the dependecies use
```
pip install -e .
```

To start, you can play with the following notebook:

* "[CURE Example Code](https://github.com/F-Salehi/CURE_robustness/blob/master/notebooks/example.ipynb) "

It trains a robust _ architecture on CIFAR-10, which achieves _ % and _ % clean and adversarial accuracies respectively.
